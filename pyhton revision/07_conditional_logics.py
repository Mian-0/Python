#logical operators are either "true or false" or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
#  equal to                         ==
#  not equal to                     !=

#  less than or equal to            <=
#  greater than or equal to         >=

#is 4 equal to 4?
# print(4==4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>3)

# application of logical operators
# hammad_age=4
# age_at_School=5
# print(hammad_age==age_at_School)

# input operators and logicals

student_age = input("How old are you? ") #input function taking age
student_age = int(student_age)
print(student_age==age_at_School) #logical operator is checking condition is true or false
